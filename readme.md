# Install WordPress in 3 minutes!  

We used to say that WordPress is installed in 5 minutes...  
With this script you can easily install WordPress Multisite in 3 minutes 

## How it's working?  
This is a bash script you have to launch from a terminal or an SSH access.  
You must have [wp-cli](https://wp-cli.org/) installed.  
You'll have to answer some question (same as in classical installation ) and then going to drink a coffee.  
If all answers are correct, WordPress should be installed before you finished drinking the coffee!

After installation, you'll just have to create an .htaccess file by visiting the permalink page or in Multisite, copying the Settings / Network settings data.
